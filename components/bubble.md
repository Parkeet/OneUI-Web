# Bubble


Groups elements. Provides a border and separation from other elements on the page. Classes also include styling for titles before the bubble (like contacts in the One UI app) and items inside the bubble (list items).

**TODO**
Add preview

Example :
```
<div class="oui-bubble">
    <!-- Any content you want -->
</div>

```
