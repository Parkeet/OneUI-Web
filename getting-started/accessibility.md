# Accessibility

OneUI Web aims to ensure a fair, equal, and considerate user experience for everyone, regardless 
of their gender or physical condition. The accessibility guidelines strive to meet the 
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) developed through the W3C process and 
are based in One UI Design Accesibility Principles:


- Consideration


Empathetic and detailed design for all users
At Samsung, we’re always trying to simplify our products’ interface, employing a 
variety of research methodologies so that our design approach aligns with the needs and 
desires of our users. We strive to listen to our users and make a sincere effort to understand them, 
including those with disabilities. 


- Comprehensive


Balanced and equal design for all users
We aim to design an interface for all users, regardless of whether they have a disability. 
At Samsung, we believe that users with disabilities shouldn’t experience difficulty or discrimination when interacting with our products. We have set up guidelines in consideration of users with varying degrees of disabilities. From as early as the planning stage of each product, we try to ensure that it provides a holistic experience for all users.


- Coherence


Consistent design experience for all products
Samsung products provide a variety of optional features for people with limited mobility. Moreover, continuous research and development in accessibility design should further ensure that all Samsung products offer an equal level of functionality for all their users.


- Co-creation


Designed together
Samsung’s dedicated team of professionals from various fields provides training and support for users with disabilities to help them use Samsung products and services without difficulty. Employees with disabilities, research institutes, and like-minded communities and groups all work together to take a more hands-on approach to our design experience.
